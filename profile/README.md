# Roving Robotics ðŸ¤–

**Welcome to Roving Robotics!**

This repository follows my journey through the exciting world of robotics, drones, and control systems. This space is dedicated to sharing my projects, from drone innovations to engineering challenges, and documenting my experiences at robotics conferences and student activities.

## What you'll find here:
- **Drone Projects**: Building and programming drones for various applications, including my Disaster Response Observation Network (D.R.O.N.) project.
- **Robotics & Control Systems**: Projects that explore the control, autonomy, and mechanics of robots.
- **Conference Notes & Resources**: Insights and takeaways from attending robotics and controls conferences.
- **Student Engineering Projects**: A glimpse into the challenges and solutions from my coursework and extracurricular activities.
